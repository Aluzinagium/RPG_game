A Text Based RPG Game
A project with the objective of getting a Text-based RPG game working, with a good amount of places to explore and NPC's to encounter/fight/talk to. 
Now the project is in it's initial stage, being "alive" for so little time, but I intend on keeping it being updated with it's features. I have some other things in mind to add to it but
I don't think I'm capable of it yet. 

Sorry for the lack of content for now! I'll try to make it fun, I promise! o7

Prepared some files to accept NPC and Locations that I'm going to add in the future. 
Save system is not working anymore, but I'm not focusing on it for now.
I'll try to work on NPC and Location generation and then I'm focusing on the Loot and Combat system!
