A Text Based RPG Game
A project with the objective of getting a Text-based RPG game working, with a good amount of places to explore and NPC's to encounter/fight/talk to. 
Now the project is in it's initial stage, being "alive" for so little time, but I intend on keeping it being updated with it's features. I have some other things in mind to add to it but
I don't think I'm capable of it yet. 

Sorry for the lack of content for now! I'll try to make it fun, I promise! o7
